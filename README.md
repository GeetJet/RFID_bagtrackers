# RFID_bagtrackers
This code implements connection of RFID RC522 with the rfid tags . The RC522 is connected with a Wiznet board which inturn is connected to the LED and buzzer.The data sensed is sent to server / MQTT lens(Using the MQTT protocol).
The code files Linked are as follows :
RFID_TEST: For initial tesing of our RFID's.
FinalMQTTWiz: The Code which is Implemented in our project to show how tags Once sensed by the RFID RC522 can be send data to the MQTT Lens or any server we wish to send.
Conveyor.Java:This was made using JOGL(Java Open Graphics Library).This is the conveyor belt graphics that we have shown in the Project video.
